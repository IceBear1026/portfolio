                When a SMALL PIECE of data is encrypted using RSA, an attacker can craft a series of ciphertexts and use the decryption of these ciphertexts to reveal the original small piece of data eventually. - Chosen ciphertext attack.<br><br>
                Padding is used to PREVENT this attack by ensuring that the plaintexts are sufficiently long and random so that the attacker can't craft meaningful ciphertexts. <br><br>

                PKCS1_OAEP cipher algorithm - Public-Key Cryptography Standards #1 - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption PADDING.<br><br>
                OAEP provides a specific method of padding that adds randomness to the data before it's encrypted, increasing the security of the encryption.<br><br>
                Usually, people would add a bunch of 0's to match the number of blocks that are created. OAEP algorithm uses pair of random oracles, "G" and "H."
                Combining this padding with trapdoor one-way permutation (In this case, RSA public key algorithm), it proved to provide security against chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks. 
                Overall, OAEP provides an element of randomness to convert a <strong>DETERMINISTIC</strong> encryption scheme (bare RSA) into a <strong>PROBABILISTIC</strong> scheme. (Making the encryption harder to guess).<br><br>
                It also prevents PARTIAL decryption of ciphertexts (or other information LEAKAGE) because the hacker can not recover a portion of plaintext without being able to invert the TRAPDOOR ONE-WAY PERMUTATION. <br>

                MAC: Message Authentication Code - a short piece of information used to confirm that a message came from the stated sender (authentication) and has not been changed in transit (integrity). It’s like a cryptographic SEAL on a message.<br><br>

                CBC stands for “Cipher Block Chaining,” which is used to calculate MAC. <br><br>
                When you have a message, you break them into blocks. And each of these blocks is “chained” with the previous one by mathematical operation before being encrypted. The result of this chaining and encryption is the MAC.<br><br>
                This chaining mechanism means that even a small change in the message will cause a big change in the MAC, making it virtually impossible for an attack to change the message and still keep the same MAC.
                This provides integrity of the message because it will be easy to see if the message has been tampered with during transit.

                <strong>Key Generation:</strong> 
                The key used in AES for CMAC is derived from a secret key K, which is first used to encrypt a block of ZEROs. The output is then processed to create two more keys: K1 and K2 (also known as subkeys). These subkeys are used for padding the message in the final steps of the CMAC algorithm.<br><br> 
                <strong>Message Preparation:</strong>
                The input message is divided into blocks (M1, M2, …, Mn). If the last block is not the full block size, it’s padded. If it’s a complete block, a new block is added. <br><br>
                The PADDING depends on whether the LAST BLOCK is complete or not.<br><br>
                If it’s complete, the padding is a full block of the form ‘K1 || 0^nb’, where ‘||’ denotes concatenation and ‘0’nb’ represents a string of zeros of the necessary length.<br><br>
                If it’s not complete, the padding is of the form ‘Mn || 10^r’, where ‘10^r’ is a string starting with ‘1’ followed by ‘r’ zeros, and ‘r’ is the number of bits required to complete the block. This incomplete block is then XORed with K1.<br><br>
                <strong>MAC Computations:</strong>
                CBC-MAC is performed on the prepared blocks. <br><br>This involves:
                Initializing an AES cipher with the secret key K. 
                Starting with an initialization vector (IV), the blocks are processed one by one. Each block is XOR-ed with the output of the previous encryption, and the result is encrypted with AES. 
                The output from the final block’s encryption is the MAC.

                <strong>SubKeys Generation (In-Depth):</strong>
                First, a single block of zeros is encrypted using the original key K.
                Let the output be L. Now, L is shifted one bit to the left. In other words, each bit i of L is replaced by the bit i+1, with the 0th bith replaced by 0. Let’s call the result L1.
                Shift L one bit to the left (equivalent to multiplying L by 2 in binary).<br><br>
                If the most significant (leftmost) bit of L before the shift was 1, then a constant Rb is XORed with L1 to give K1. If it was 0, then K1 is just L1.
                The constant Rb depends on the block length (for a block length of 128 bits, as in AES, Rb is 0x87).
                K2 is generated in a similar way, except it starts with K1 instead of L. K1 is shifted one bit to the left, and Rb is XORed with the result if the most significant bit of K1 was 1. The result is K2. <br><br>

                When we talk about shifting bits in a fixed-size binary number (like our 128-bit block in AES), we essentially “move” each bit from one position to the left. When you shift all the bits to the left, the leftmost bit (the MSB before the shift) is discarded, and a new 0 is inserted on the rightmost side. <br><br>
                For example, let’s take an 8-bit binary number, 10110011. If we shift this one bit to the left, we get 01100110. The leftmost 1 in the original number is gone, and a new 0 has been added on the right.<br><br>
                In the context of CMAC subkey generation:
                If the MSB (Most Significant Bit) of L (before shifting) is 1, this means that when we shift L to the left, we’re effectively “losing” a 1 because it’s discarded. To counter this, we XOR the result with a constant Rb (0x87 for 128-bit blocks).
                If the MSB of L (before shifting) is 0, then no information is lost in the shift, and we can simply take the result of the shift as K1 or K2. 
                <br><br>
                When we XOR K1 or K2 with the final block, it guarantees that even a small change in the message (even just changing the message’s length) will cause a significant change in the resulting CMAC, making it difficult for an attacker to modify the message without being detected.

                <strong>Rb - Finite field arithmetic</strong>
                The specific finite field we’re interested in is called GF(2^128) because we’re dealing with 128 bits at a time in AES.<br><br>
                When we do certain operations in this field, such as shifting bits, we need to make sure that we don’t accidentally create a binary number that’s longer than 128 bits. That’s where Rb comes in.
                Think about Rb as a special number that we use to keep our binary numbers in check. When we shift our bits to the left and the leftmost bit is 1 (which means it will be “pushed out” and make room for an extra 0 on the right), we add in this special number Rb using a process called XOR - a way of combining two bits.

                When dealing with IAM services on AWS make sure to practice least privilege. Meaning if the developer within the company needs to access S3 bucket, only provide specific role that the developer needs NOT full access to S3. <br><br>
                Slim down the scope of attack vectors by limiting specific IP address that can access AWS resources using security group. For example, who can access ssh protocol. <br><br>
                Create cloudwatch + cloudtrail monitoring and logging management to keep track of which user has accessed and triggered the create_object or delete object function within S3. <br><br>
                Although ransomware attack mostly affects the availability of data security, some sensitive data has more negative impact in loss of confidentiality. And so it’s also recommended that within your aws, make sure to leverage the AWS KMS to practice separation of duties by having two separate roles to access important data. For example, one user can have access to the data and another person can have access to the cryptographic keys. (Developer and security engineers)<br><br>
                Make sure to create versioning for the buckets that is used.
