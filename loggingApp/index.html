                Under VirtualBox network manager and zero_two_network, both VMs are in promiscuous mode, meaning that they are able to understand each other’s existences within the network. 
                <br>
                Both virtual machines are updated and upgraded with Openssh-server and ufw installed, where they allow port 22 and ssh protocol to be enabled.

                Run nnmap on the target IP address 10.0.2.100:
                <br>
                    - nmap -sV -e enp0s3 -S 10.0.2.99 10.0.2.100
                <br> 
                        - Using -S, I am spoofing my IP address to be 10.0.2.99<br>
                        - Using -sV I check for the versions of the software<br>
                        - Using enp0s3 (virtualbox - default virtual NIC), I can spoof the IP address that has assigned to it.<br><br>

                While running nmap on the attacker VM, run this command on the target VM:<br>
                    - tcpdump -p -i enp0s3 -n<br>
                        - It will collect all the TCP packets and see the spoofed IP address running nmap.<br>
                        - (This is just a simulation, so I wanted to show that the spoofed IP address is working.)<br><br>

                After nmap scan of the internal network, the hacker will be able to collect information as such as the fact that the VM is a virtual machine, its MAC address, versions of OS and software installed, and ports that are open.

                Now, typically hackers will try default credentials or try brute-force attempts. Since I know this machine is a VM from Virtualbox Hypervisor, I can try to use default credentials: username - "vboxuser" and password - "changeme".
                <br><br>
                Then I can escalate my privilege with the same password using superuser command and "changeme".

                I intended to develop an independent Python script designed to attract the user's attention and prompt them to click on it, initiating its execution on their screen. That's why I placed both tkinter.py and an image.desktop file on the Desktop. By creating a desktop icon with an enticing appearance, the user is more likely to click on it. Before the user interacts with the icon, a tkinter.py script will be executed, which will, in turn, activate the keylogger.py to run discreetly in the background.

    <section id="paragraph">
        <div class="explanation">
            <p>
                The challenge:<br>
                    The reason why I did not directly run the keylogger script from the ssh screen is the limitation in using pynput module. <br><br>
                    Reference: https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html<br><br>
                    So if I ran:<br>
                        ssh root@10.0.2.100 -X “python3 /etc/keylogger.py”<br><br>
                    It would only capture the virtual machine (the Attacker VM) that is running the script because of pynput’s $DISPLAY and X-server limitations. When running it this way, you also have to configure the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to be able to run a script through ssh.<br><br>
                    Following configuration:<br><br>
                        PasswordAuthentication yes<br>
                        KdbInteractiveAuthentication no<br>
                        PermitRootLogin yes<br>
                        Pubkey Authentication no<br>
                        X11Forwarding yes<br>
                        X11DisplayOffset 10<br>
                        X11UseLocalhost yes<br><br>
                    Then service ssh restart<br><br>
                    The problem with this approach is that -X server only scans the local screen that it’s capturing. So if I were to run the python script, it would only capture the ssh remote session on the attacker VM screen.
                    <br><br>
                Another challenge:<br>
                    I tried to make the script run on the background every time the virtual machine rebooted. So then I used the cron service.<br>
                        Command:<br>
                            Crontab -e<br>
                        Then in the file, I write:<br>
                            @reboot /usr/bin/python3 /etc/keylogger.py<br><br>
